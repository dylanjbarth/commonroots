<p>As a first step in our learning journey, we have signed up for the self-paced <a href="https://kisstheground.mykajabi.com/kiss-the-ground-s-soil-advocate-training-90befcf2-102f-4937-a839-6f8bf7d8957c?preview_theme_id=2591978">Soil Advocate Training</a> course developed by Kiss the Ground (the non-profit with the same mission and name as the awesome documentary). They advertise the Soil Advocate Training as a way to learn more about the principles of regenerative agriculture and learn how to actually advocate for these principles with different audiences. </p>



<p>After purchasing access to the course ($149 at time of writing), we created a username and password allowing us to login to a portal that contained the course content. The course is organized into 8 modules and they recommend that you try and make your way through it at a sustainable pace, spending 1-2 hours on it per week and making it through the course in about 8 weeks. It looks like the first 6 modules are focused on the principles of regenerative agriculture and the last two address how you can spread the message effectively. </p>



<p>As we make progress through the course, we will be updating this main post with links to other posts summarizing what we are learning and linking out to other great learning resources. </p>
